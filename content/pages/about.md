Hi! I'm a senior software engineer most recently employed at [Blizzard Entertainment](https://www.blizzard.com/), working on video game servers. I am [open for work!](/daniel-waechter-resume-2025.pdf)

I'm originally from Orange County, California, but I currently live in [Salem, Massachusetts](https://www.salem.org/), the Witch City.

I'm a husband, a father of two, and a nerd. I like tabletop RPGs, CRPGs, strategy games, space sims, and CCGs like Magic: The Gathering.

I'm a programming language [wonk](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wonk). In particular, I'm a huge fan of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). This site is created with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a static site generator written in Rust.
